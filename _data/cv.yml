      description:
        - During my stay at CIEMAT, I worked on one of the research lines of the Environment department, which involved performing a synoptic circulation classification of the Iberian Peninsula, as well as regionalizing various meteorological variables and atmospheric pollutants for several databases, both experimental (E-OBS) and modeled (IFS). The two main objectives were to observe the differences between the model and the observations and to study the impact of meteorology on pollutants.

      description:
        - During my stay, I developed an SQL database with a visual interface to store the experiment's metadata. For that purpose, a program called "restFileIndexer" was used to index the ROOT CERN files containing the experimental metadata. This metadata was automatically stored in an PostgreSQL database and then visualized via the web using CloudBeaver. The entire code was developed in C++ using ROOT CERN libraries.

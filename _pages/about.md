I studied Physics at the University of Salamanca, where I discovered my passion for phenomenological physics, particularly in the context of astrophysical objects and Dark Matter. Consequently, I pursued a Master's degree in "Physics of the Universe" at the University of Zaragoza, renowned for its Dark Matter experts, both theoretical and experimental.

At Zaragoza, the IAXO group offered me a two-year contract to develop programming tools for the team. Simultaneously, I have been working on X-ray astronomy analysis tools using data from NuSTAR, SWIFT, and CHANDRA. Additionally, I am involved in projects related to Axion searches in stars using X-rays.

During my first year of the contract, I had the opportunity to go to CERN to learn about GEANT4, a C++ toolkit for simulating high-energy physics events. I also traveled to DTU in Copenhagen to work on the inventory of NuSTAR glass, which will be used for the International Axion Observatory (IAXO).
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I studied Physics at the University of Salamanca, where I discovered my passion for phenomenological physics, particularly in the context of astrophysical objects and Dark Matter. Consequently, I pursued a Master's degree in "Physics of the Universe" at the University of Zaragoza, renowned for its Dark Matter experts, both theoretical and experimental.

At Zaragoza, the IAXO group offered me a two-year contract to develop programming tools for the team. Simultaneously, I have been working on X-ray astronomy analysis tools using data from NuSTAR, SWIFT, and CHANDRA. Additionally, I am involved in projects related to Axion searches in stars using X-rays.

During my first year of the contract, I had the opportunity to go to CERN to learn about GEANT4, a C++ toolkit for simulating high-energy physics events. I also traveled to DTU in Copenhagen to work on the inventory of NuSTAR glass, which will be used for the International Axion Observatory (IAXO).

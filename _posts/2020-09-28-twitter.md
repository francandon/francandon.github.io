During my stay at the University of Zaragoza, I, along with my friend Miguel, created several videos for the CAPA social media. One of them was a promotional video for the Physics of the Universe master's program. The number of people enrolled that year had been very low, so we decided to promote the Masterâ€™s program by interviewing former students like myself.

We recorded the video in the courtyard of the Faculty of Science on a beautiful day in March.

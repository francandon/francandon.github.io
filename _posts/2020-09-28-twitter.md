During my stay at University of Zaragoza, I created together with my friend Miguel several videos for the CAPA social media. One of them was a promotional video for the Physics of the Universe master's program. The number of people enrolled during that year had been very low, so we decided to promote the Master interviewing former students as myself. 
We recorded the video in the courtyard of the Faculty of Science, a beutiful day of March

Last week, I presented the final project for the "Master in Physics of the Universe: Cosmology, Astrophysics, Particles, and Astroparticles" at the University of Zaragoza, which was awarded with honors.

The main objective of the final project was the study of magnetars, neutron stars with magnetic fields reaching 10^14-15 Gauss, through observations conducted with the space observatories NuSTAR, Swift, and Chandra.
